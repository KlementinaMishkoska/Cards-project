## Usage

The app uses fetch to get data from a local .json file, simulating a backend call. To avoid CORS-related errors, the app should be ran in a local server.


After pulling the project locally, run the following command in your terminal (in the project's root directory), in order to install a simple http server and run the app,

```console
npx http-server
```

If you're asked to install the npm plugin globally, input Y and proceed.
